> Well documented, scaleable, efficient, web dev framework with a rich set of tools, APIs and libs, and a large and active community.

Developed by Google.

Angular is used for building SPAs, whereby all the necessary code is loaded in to a single page.

Content changes are rendered dynamically, loading only that part of the page that needs updating.  Reduces traffic and increases responsiveness.
