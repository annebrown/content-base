MkDocs and its [add-ons](../mkdocs/add-ons/index.md), provide a framework for deploying documention-based static sites.  

MkDocs is quick to learn and deploy.  It's specific focus and design make it suitable for a customizable, fast, and efficient SSG.  While it doesn't require as much coding knowledge as some other framweorks, tradeoffs include less control over design and layout.
