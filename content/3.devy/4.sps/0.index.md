You're right, the previous methods won't work for your specific case because a CNAME record for "www" wouldn't work and the `vercel.json` redirect would point to your dummy project. Here's how you can achieve the redirect for "www" across your multiple top-level domains with Vercel:

**Solution 1: Using Vercel Wildcard Domain and Edge Functions:**

1. **Create a Wildcard Domain:**
   - In your Vercel project settings, under "Domains," add a wildcard domain using an asterisk (`*.yourdomain.tld`). This captures all subdomains under your top-level domains (e.g., *.misscommunication.ca, *[invalid URL removed]).

2. **Create an Edge Function:**
   - Implement an Edge Function in your Vercel project using JavaScript, TypeScript, or another supported language. This function will handle the redirect logic based on the requested domain name.
   - Here's a sample Edge Function script (in JavaScript) to redirect "www" across all your domains:

   ```javascript
   export default async function (request) {
     const url = new URL(request.url);
     const hostname = url.hostname;

     // Check if the hostname starts with "www."
     if (hostname.startsWith('www.')) {
       // Redirect to your external URL with a permanent status code (301)
       return new Response('Redirecting...', {
         status: 301,
         headers: {
           Location: 'https://mc-ca.nuxt.dev',
         },
       });
     }

     // If not "www", continue with the original request
     return await fetch(request);
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy your project:**
   - Deploy your Vercel project with the Edge Function.

**Explanation:**

* This approach leverages the power of Vercel's Edge Network to handle the redirect at the edge before the request reaches your dummy project.
* The Edge Function checks the requested hostname and redirects only when it starts with "www."
* This ensures that all your top-level domains with the "www" subdomain get redirected to the external URL.

**Solution 2: Using a Custom Domain and Serverless Function (Advanced):**

This method is more advanced and requires additional configuration.

1. **Create a Custom Domain:**
   - In your Vercel project settings, add a custom domain specifically for handling redirects, like "redirect.yourdomain.tld".

2. **Create a Serverless Function:**
   - Implement a serverless function using a platform like AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions, or Vercel Functions (if available).
   - This function will receive the request and perform the redirect based on the subdomain information extracted from the URL.

3. **Configure DNS for Custom Domain:**
   - Set an A record for "redirect.yourdomain.tld" pointing to the IP address provided by your serverless function platform.

4. **Deploy your function:**
   - Deploy your serverless function to the platform you chose.

**Considerations:**

* Setting up serverless functions adds complexity compared to the Edge Function approach.
* Choose a serverless platform that best suits your requirements and technical expertise.

**Important Note:**

* Whichever method you choose, remember to deploy your project for the changes to take effect.
* It might take some time for the DNS changes to propagate across the internet.

Both solutions will allow you to redirect "www" across your multiple top-level domains with Vercel, directing users to your desired external URL.  Choose the method that best fits your comfort level and technical setup.
